in this approach of module development we have noticed

the variables has to be defined in main.tf outside the module and in variables.tf inside the module.

then we need to prepare a terraform.tfvars file outside the module to populate the value for each variable.

if we miss to define a vaiable in terrraform .tfvars file that is being used in any of the modules  then it will prompt to provide that variable definition
